// Big O notation

//O(log n), also known as log time. Example: Binary search.
//O(n), also known as linear time. Example: Simple search.
//O(n * log n). Example: A fast sorting algorithm, like quicksort
//O(n2). Example: A slow sorting algorithm, like selection sort.
//O(n!). Example: A really slow algorithm, like the traveling salesperson.
